Test the functionalities first. Check my comments on the line 59 to 61 for instructions on how to do so.
Kindly report if there are issues encountered, after changing values.
Also, do read the comments first before changing values.
For optimal performance, once everything was finalized. Remove all the Serial.print statements, as those are only used for debugging. 
Change line 68 operation also, depending if you want to get all the less than or greater than values of the scanned distance and the set distance in line 25 
Distance lower than 400mm won't also yield accurate result, but continue testing it. 
If there are issues on the Sensor like Line 81 not printing on the serial, please look for sample codes online and send it to me so I can revise this, free of charge. 
Should you guys have questions or concerns, please do reach me. Thank you
